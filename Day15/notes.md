# Day 15 – Linux Advanced Revision

## Focus of the Day
Today was a revision-focused day to strengthen Linux fundamentals and revisit important concepts that are heavily used in DevOps on a daily basis.

---

## Why an Operating System Is Needed

An Operating System acts as an interface between:
- User applications
- Hardware resources

Responsibilities of an OS:
- Process management
- Memory management
- File system management
- Device management
- Security and access control

Without an OS, users and applications cannot directly interact with hardware efficiently.

---

## Linux vs Windows (High-Level Comparison)

Linux is preferred in DevOps and server environments because:
- It is open-source and free
- Highly secure and stable
- Lightweight and fast (CLI-based)
- Better automation support
- Large ecosystem and community
- Widely used in servers, cloud, containers, and Kubernetes

Windows is more GUI-focused and commonly used for desktop and enterprise user applications.

---

## Brief History of Linux

- Linux kernel was created by Linus Torvalds
- Inspired by Unix philosophy
- Designed to be modular, secure, and scalable
- Became the backbone of modern infrastructure (cloud, containers, Kubernetes)

---

## Main Components of Linux OS

- Kernel: Core of the OS, manages CPU, memory, devices, and system calls
- Shell: Interface for users to interact with the system
- System Libraries: Provide functionality for applications
- System Utilities: Tools for system operations
- User Processes: Applications running on the system

---

## Linux Distributions

Linux has multiple distributions (distros) built on top of the same kernel.

Examples:
- Ubuntu
- CentOS / Rocky Linux
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Debian
- Amazon Linux

Different distros exist to serve different use cases like servers, desktops, security, and cloud.

---

## Package Managers

Package managers are used to install, update, and remove software.

Examples:
- apt (Ubuntu/Debian)
- yum / dnf (CentOS, RHEL)
- pacman (Arch)

They handle:
- Dependency resolution
- Version management
- Secure installations

---

## Linux Directory Structure

Important directories and their purpose:
- /bin → Essential user binaries
- /sbin → System binaries
- /etc → Configuration files
- /var → Logs and variable data
- /usr → User applications and libraries
- /home → User home directories
- /root → Root user home
- /tmp → Temporary files

Understanding this structure is critical for debugging and administration.

---

## User Management

Revisited user management concepts:
- useradd → Low-level command, requires manual configuration
- adduser → High-level, interactive, user-friendly

---

## Groups in Linux

Groups are used to:
- Manage permissions efficiently
- Allow multiple users to access shared resources
- Simplify access control

Users can belong to multiple groups.

---

## File Management & Navigation

Revisited core file system operations:
- Navigating directories
- Creating and managing files
- Moving and copying files

Common commands revised:
- pwd
- ls
- cd
- whoami

---

## Vim Editor Revision

Revisited Vim editor basics:
- Insert, command, and visual modes
- Copy, paste, delete lines
- Navigation shortcuts
- Saving and exiting files

Vim is heavily used in servers and DevOps environments.

---

## File Viewing Commands

Revisited commands used for viewing file content:
- head
- tail
- less
- more

These are useful for:
- Viewing logs
- Debugging applications
- Monitoring system behavior

---

## Summary

- Strengthened Linux fundamentals
- Revised OS concepts and architecture
- Revisited file system structure and commands
- Improved comfort with Vim
- Reinforced user and group management basics

---

## Plan for Tomorrow (Day 16)

Topics planned:
- Linux permissions
- Process management
- Networking basics

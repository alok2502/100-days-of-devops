## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a **culture and set of practices** followed within an organization to **speed up application delivery** while maintaining **high quality and reliability**.

DevOps focuses on:
- Automation
- Code quality checks
- Continuous testing
- Continuous monitoring
- Faster and safer releases

The **end goal of DevOps** is to deliver a **high-quality product to users as quickly as possible**.

DevOps is not just a tool or a role — it is a **mindset** that encourages collaboration between development and operations teams.

## Why DevOps Is Needed?

To understand why DevOps emerged, it helps to look at how things worked earlier.

### Traditional Model (Before DevOps)

Around 10 years ago, there was **no DevOps role**. The workflow looked like this:

1. Developer writes code and pushes it to a central repository
2. System Administrator creates and manages servers
3. Build & Release Engineer deploys the application
4. QA team tests the application on the server
5. If tests pass, the application is promoted to staging/pre-production
6. After further testing, it finally goes to production

### Problems with This Approach
- Multiple teams involved
- Heavy manual work
- Slow delivery cycles
- High chances of human error
- Poor collaboration and feedback loops

### How DevOps Solves This

DevOps was introduced to:
- Reduce manual work using automation
- Improve collaboration between teams
- Deliver features faster
- Reduce deployment failures
- Enable continuous feedback and monitoring

---

## Day-to-Day Role of a DevOps Engineer

A DevOps Engineer primarily focuses on:

- Automating build, test, and deployment processes
- Ensuring code quality through CI pipelines
- Managing infrastructure and environments
- Setting up monitoring and logging
- Improving system reliability and scalability
- Reducing deployment risks and downtime

In short, a DevOps Engineer ensures that **software moves from code to production smoothly, safely, and quickly**.

## What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?

SDLC is a **structured process** followed by organizations to design, develop, test, and deploy software.

It defines **how an application moves from idea to production**.

---

## Phases of SDLC

### 1️⃣ Planning
- Requirements are gathered
- Business goals are discussed
- Scope and timelines are defined

### 2️⃣ Defining
- Requirements are documented clearly
- Functional and non-functional needs are finalized

### 3️⃣ Designing
- High-Level Design (HLD)
- Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Architecture decisions are made

### 4️⃣ Building
- Developers write the actual application code
- Features are implemented

### 5️⃣ Testing
- Application is deployed to a test environment
- QA engineers validate functionality and performance

### 6️⃣ Deployment
- Application is promoted to staging / pre-production
- Further validation is done
- Finally released to production

This cycle continues for every new feature or change.

## Where DevOps Fits in SDLC

DevOps mainly integrates into the following SDLC phases:

- **Building**
- **Testing**
- **Deployment**

DevOps helps these phases by:
- Automating builds and deployments
- Running tests automatically
- Enabling faster feedback loops
- Reducing manual errors
- Accelerating release cycles

DevOps does not replace SDLC — it **optimizes and accelerates it**.

---

## Key Takeaways

- DevOps is a culture focused on speed, quality, and reliability
- Traditional software delivery was slow and error-prone
- DevOps emerged to automate and streamline delivery
- SDLC defines the lifecycle of software development
- DevOps enhances SDLC by automating critical phases
